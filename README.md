#Fibonacci Calculator

This calculates [fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

I wrote this as an exploration of elegant recursion solutions. In my exploration, I realized that I couldn't
calculate numbers above 80 without hitting timeout errors. Thus, I included memoization to keep the process
elegant and make it fast.
